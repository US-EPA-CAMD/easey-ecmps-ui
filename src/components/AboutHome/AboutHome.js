          <p className="text-bold font-heading-md">
            The Emissions Collection and Monitoring Plan System 2.0 Beta is the
            new web-based reporting tool released in beta form to allow industry
            users and the public to begin testing and learning the new
            application. The initial application, released in December of 2021,
            begins with the limited functionality of view (no login required)
            and edit/evaluate (

            required) of monitoring plan data. Subsequent releases throughout
            2022 will add import and export functionality and the additional
            data typesâ€”QA, certifications, and emissions. Data in the beta is
            not production data and is only being used for testing purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two primary goals of the extended beta process.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Allow users to learn the new web-based reporting tool and
                provide feedback to EPA.
              </li>
              <li>
                Allow EPA time to test and integrate the beta application into
                the future production environment and incorporate user feedback.
              </li>
